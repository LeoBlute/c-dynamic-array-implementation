# C-Dynamic-Array-Implementation
Loosely Based on [Dylan Falconer's Article](https://bytesbeneath.com/p/dynamic-arrays-in-c)<br />
This was my first fully realised implementation of Dynamic Arrays(Also know as Vectors in other languages)<br />
It includes: Insert, Remove(by index) functionality, Custom Memory Allocation, and, allows Regular C Pointer Iteration
